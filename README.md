# Welcome to The Train App POC

## Introduction
Let's start with the fact that it's a tool I've built only for myself, **Why it's even here?** Anat asked for it in exchange for 2 stickers...  
Now for the introduction:  
It all started when I wanted to know when is my next train (רכבת ישראל בלבד) and encountered the following impediments:
- the train website requires too many steps
- google assistant insists that I need a bus for a 5 minutes walk and structure a trip which is an overkill for the information I need
- I'm not going to install the official train app

In addition to that, I love fiddling around with Android application development. So, I've decided to build a simple app with only 2 buttons "To home" and "To work" and then the app displays only the relevant information I need.

## Missing features
As mentioned, It's just a simple tool that I've built for myself, meaning it's not scalable and also not the best solution to the problem, here are a few potential improvements:
1. As of this version (V0.9) the stations are hard-coded and can only be changed within the code
2. GPS location feature
3. Raw data parsing instead of a webview
4. A persistent list of routes
5. Better design

Please feel free to contribute.
